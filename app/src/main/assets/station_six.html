<p><strong>Leader:</strong> We adore you, O Christ, and we praise you.<br /> <strong>All:</strong> Because by your holy cross You have redeemed the world.<br /><br /> Jesus, suddenly a woman comes out of the crowd. Her name is Veronica. You can see how she cares for you as she takes a cloth and begins to wipe the blood and sweat from your face. She can't do much, but she offers what little help she can.<br /><br /> As a child, sometimes I know someone could use a little help and understanding. They may be picked on or teased by others, or just sad or lonely. Sometimes I feel bad that others don't step in to help, but I don't help either.<br /><br /> As an adult, I notice the needs around me. Sometimes my own family members crave my attention, and I don't even seem to notice. Sometimes a co-worker, friend, or family member could use help or understanding, but I don't reach out to help lest I be criticized, or that they demand more of me than I'd like to give. <br /><br /> My tender Jesus, Who didst deign to print Thy sacred face upon the cloth with which Veronica wiped the sweat from off Thy brow, print in my soul deep, I pray Thee, the lasting memory of Thy bitter pains.<br /><br /> Our Father.... Hail Mary.... Glory be to the Father....<br /><br /> <strong>Leader:</strong> Jesus Christ Crucified.<br /> <strong>All:</strong> Have mercy on Us.<br /> <strong>Leader:</strong> May the souls of the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, Rest in peace.<br /> <strong>All:</strong> Amen.</p>
