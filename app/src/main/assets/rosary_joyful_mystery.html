                <p>In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary. And the angel came in unto her, and said: "Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women". And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.And the angel said unto her:" Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God. And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest"... And Mary said:" Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word". And the angel departed from her. <em> (Luk 1,26-38) </em></p>
                <p><em>Oh Mary with Your "yes" You have opened heaven's ways, You have achieved the will of the Father. You will be blessed for ever: Your intercession is heard in Heaven, because You have accepted God's plan. Let us pray that we can say "yes" to the Father in every instance He ask it of us. Mary help us to be humble and obedient to God's will.</em></p>

                    <p>Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda. And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth. And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost and she spoke out with a loud voice, and said: "Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb". ... And Mary said: "My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.
