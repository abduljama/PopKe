	<p>Almighty and ever living father,</p>
<p>You chose your servant Pope Francis as the successor of apostle Peter and Shepard of your flock.</p>
<p>Look favourably, we pray, on his pastoral visit to our nation Kenya. Inspire us to receive him well.</p>
<p>May your Holy Spirit enlighten our minds and hearts to be generous and receptive to his message and encouragement.</p>
<p>Grant that he may be for us, your people, a visible bond of unity which brings healing and reconciliation, love and peace;</p>
<p>so that in you, the Shepard of souls, all may know the truth and attain eternal life. Amen</p>
	</body>
