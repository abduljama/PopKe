	HOLY ROSARY (Latin)

	I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth. And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord; who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary; suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead and buried; he descended into hell; the third day he rose again from the dead; he ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty; from thence he shall come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit; the Holy Catholic Church; the communion of Saints; the forgiveness of sins; the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen.

	Thou, o Lord, wilt open my lips.
	And my tongue shall announce thy praise.
	Incline to my aid, o God,
	Lord, make haste to help me.
	Glory beâ€¦
