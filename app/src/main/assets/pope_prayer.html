<h2 style="text-align: center;"><em>Prayer for the Pope Visit&nbsp; To Kenya</em></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Almighty and ever living father, You chose your servant Pope Francis as the successor of Apostle Peter and Shepard of your flock.</em></p>
<p><em>Look favourably, we pray, on his pastoral visit to our nation Kenya. Inspire us to receive him well.</em></p>
<p><em>May your Holy Spirit enlighten our minds and hearts to be generous and receptive to his message and encouragement.</em></p>
<p><em>Grant that he may be for us, your people, a visible bond of unity which brings healing and reconciliation, love and peace; So that in you, the Shepard of Souls, all may know the truth and attain eternal life. </em></p>
<p><em>Amen.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
