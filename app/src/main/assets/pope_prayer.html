<h2 style="text-align: center;">Prayer for the Pope Visit&nbsp; To Kenya</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Almighty and ever living father, You chose your servant Pope Francis as the successor of Apostle Peter and Shepherd of your flock.</p>
<p>Look favourably, we pray, on his pastoral visit to our nation Kenya. Inspire us to receive him well.</p>
<p>May your Holy Spirit enlighten our minds and hearts to be generous and receptive to his message and encouragement.</p>
<p>Grant that he may be for us, your people, a visible bond of unity which brings healing and reconciliation, love and peace; So that in you, the Shepherd of Souls, all may know the truth and attain eternal life.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
