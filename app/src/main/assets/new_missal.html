<h1>THE ORDER OF MASS</h1>
<div class="explanation">
    <h1><span style="color: #ff0000;">The Introductory Rites</span></h1>
    <p>The Introductory Rites help the faithful come together as one, establish communion and prepare themselves properly to listen to the Word of God and to celebrate the Eucharist worthily.</p>
</div>
<p class="rubric">All stand. The Priest approaches the altar with the ministers and venerates it while the Entrance Song is sung</p>
<h3>Sign of the Cross</h3>
<p class="rubric">All make the Sign of the Cross as the Priest says.</p>
<div class="celebrant">In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.</div>
<p class="rubric">The people reply:</p>
<div class="people">Amen.</div>
<h3>Greeting</h3>

<p class="rubric">The Priest, or a Deacon, or another minister, may very briefly introduce the faithful to the Mass of the day.</p>

<h3>The Collect</h3>
<p class="rubric">The Priest says:</p>
<div class="celebrant">Let us pray.</div>
<p class="rubric">And all pray in silence with the Priest for a while. Then the Priest says the Collect prayer, at the end of which the people acclaim:</p>
<div class="people">Amen.</div>
<div class="explanation">
    <h1><span style="color: #ff0000;">The Liturgy of the Word</span></h1>
    <p>By hearing the word proclaimed in worship, the faithful again enter into the unending dialogue between God and the covenant people, a dialogue sealed in the sharing of the Eucharistic food and drink. The proclamation of the word is thus integral to the Mass and at its very centre. It is appropriate to have a brief time of quiet after the readings for those present to take the word of God to heart and begin to prepare a prayerful response to what they have heard.</p>
</div>
<p class="rubric">All sit</p>
<h3>First Reading</h3>
<p class="rubric">To indicate the end of these readings, the reader acclaims:</p>
<div class="celebrant">The word of the Lord.</div>
<p class="rubric">All reply:</p>
<div class="people">Thanks be to God.</div>
<h3>Psalm</h3>
<p class="rubric">After the First Reading the psalmist or cantor sings or says the Psalm, with the people making the response.</p>
<h3>Second Reading</h3>
<p class="rubric">On Sundays and certain other days there is a second reading. It concludes with the same responsory as above.</p>
<h3>Gospel</h3>
<p class="rubric">The assembly stands to sing the Gospel Acclamation to welcome the Gospel. They remain standing in honour of the Gospel reading, the high point of the Liturgy of the Word. At the ambo the Deacon, or the Priest says:</p>
<div class="celebrant">The Lord be with you.</div>
<p class="rubric">The people reply:</p>
<div class="people">And with your spirit.</div>
<p class="rubric">The Deacon, or the Priest:</p>
<div class="celebrant">A reading from the holy Gospel according to <span class="rubric">N.</span></div>
<p class="rubric">He makes the Sign of the Cross on the book and, together with the people, on his forehead, lips, and breast. At the same time the people acclaim:</p>
<div class="people">Glory to you, O Lord.</div>
<p class="rubric">At the end of the Gospel, the Deacon, or the Priest, acclaims:</p>
<div class="celebrant">The Gospel of the Lord.</div>
<p class="rubric">All reply:</p>
<div class="people">Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ.</div>
<p class="rubric">After the proclamation of the Gospel the congregation is seated.</p>
<h3>The Homily</h3>
<p class="rubric">At the end of the Homily it is appropriate for there to be a brief silence for recollection. The congregation then stands.</p>
<h3>The Creed</h3>
<p class="rubric">On Sundays and Solemnities, the Profession of Faith or Creed will follow. During Lent and Easter Time, especially, the Apostles&rsquo; Creed may be used.</p>

    </div>
</div>
<h3>The Prayer of the Faithful (Bidding Prayers)</h3>
<p class="rubric">After each intention there is a pause while the faithful pray. The minister says:</p>
<div class="celebrant">Lord, in your mercy.</div>
<p class="rubric">All reply:</p>
<div class="people">Hear our prayer.</div>
<p class="rubric">The Priest concludes the Prayer with a collect. When the Liturgy of the Word has been completed, the people sit.</p>
<div class="explanation">
    <h1><span style="color: #ff0000;">The Liturgy of the Eucharist</span></h1>
    <p>For Catholics, the Eucharist is the source and summit of the whole Christian life. It is the vital centre of all that the Church is and does, because at its heart is the real presence of the crucified, risen and glorified Lord, continuing and making available his saving work among us.</p>
</div>
<h3>The Offertory</h3>
<p class="rubric">During the Offertory Song the faithful usually express their participation by making an offering, bringing forward bread and wine for the celebration of the Eucharist and perhaps other gifts to relieve the needs of the Church and of the poor.</p>
<p class="rubric">When he has received the bread and wine for the celebration, the Priest offers prayer of blessing quietly at the altar. Sometimes these prayers are said aloud. If the priest says the prayers aloud the assembly&rsquo;s acclamation each time is</p>
<div class="people">Blessed be God for ever.</div>
<p class="rubric">The Priest completes additional personal preparatory rites, and the people rise as he says:</p>
<div class="celebrant">
    <div class="celebrant v">Pray, brethren <span class="rubric">(</span>brothers and sisters<span class="rubric">)</span>,</div>
    <div class="celebrant v">that my sacrifice and yours</div>
    <div class="celebrant v">may be acceptable to God,</div>
    <div class="celebrant v">the almighty Father.</div>
</div>
<p class="rubric">The people reply:</p>
<div class="people">
    <div class="v">May the Lord accept the sacrifice at your hands</div>
    <div class="v">for the praise and glory of his name,</div>
    <div class="v">for our good</div>
    <div class="v">and the good of all his holy Church.</div>
</div>
<p class="rubric">Then the Priest says the Prayer over the Offerings, at the end of which the people acclaim:</p>
<div class="people">Amen.</div>
<div class="explanation">
    <h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">THE EUCHARISTIC PRAYER</span></h2>
    <p>The Eucharistic Prayer, the centre and summit of the entire celebration is a memorial proclamation of praise and thanksgiving for God&rsquo;s work of salvation, a proclamation in which the Body and Blood of Christ are made present by the power of the Holy Spirit and the people are joined to Christ in offering his Sacrifice to the Father.</p>

    <h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">The Communion Rite</span></h2>
    <p>The eating and drinking together of the Lord&rsquo;s Body and Blood in a Paschal meal is the culmination of the Eucharist. The themes underlying these rites are the mutual love and reconciliation that are both the condition and the fruit of worthy communion and the unity of the many in the One.</p>
</div>
<h3>The Lord&rsquo;s Prayer</h3>
<p class="rubric">The congregation stands and the Priest says:</p>
<div class="celebrant">
    <div class="celebrant v">At the Saviour&rsquo;s command</div>
    <div class="celebrant v">and formed by divine teaching, we dare to say:</div>
</div>
<p class="rubric">Together with the people, he continues:</p>
<div class="people">
    <div class="v">Our Father, who art in heaven,</div>
    <div class="v">hallowed be thy name;</div>
    <div class="v">thy kingdom come,</div>

    <div class="v">Give us this day our daily bread,</div>

    <div class="v">and lead us not into temptation,</div>
    <div class="v">but deliver us from evil.</div>
</div>
<p class="rubric">The Priest alone continues, saying:</p>
<div class="celebrant">
    <div class="celebrant v">Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil,</div>
    <div class="celebrant v">graciously grant peace in our days,</div>
    <div class="celebrant v">that, by the help of your mercy,</div>
    <div class="celebrant v">we may be always free from sin</div>
    <div class="celebrant v">and safe from all distress,</div>
    <div class="celebrant v">as we await the blessed hope</div>
    <div class="celebrant v">and the coming of our Saviour, Jesus Christ.</div>
</div>
<p class="rubric">The people conclude the prayer, acclaiming:</p>
<div class="people">
    <div class="v">For the kingdom,</div>
    <div class="v">the power and the glory are yours</div>
    <div class="v">now and for ever.</div>
</div>
<p class="rubric">Then the Priest alone says aloud:</p>
<div class="celebrant">
    <div class="celebrant v">Lord Jesus Christ,</div>
    <div class="celebrant v">who said to your Apostles:</div>
    <div class="celebrant v">Peace I leave you, my peace I give you,</div>
    <div class="celebrant v">look not on our sins,</div>
    <div class="celebrant v">but on the faith of your Church,</div>

    <div class="celebrant v">in accordance with your will.</div>
    <div class="celebrant v gb">Who live and reign for ever and ever.</div>
</div>
<p class="rubric">The people reply:</p>
<div class="people">Amen.</div>
<p class="rubric">The Priest adds:</p>
<div class="celebrant">The peace of the Lord be with you always.</div>
<p class="rubric">The people reply:</p>
<div class="people">And with your spirit.</div>
<p class="rubric">The Deacon, or the Priest, adds:</p>
<div class="celebrant">Let us offer each other the sign of peace.</div>
<p class="rubric">And all offer one another the customary sign of peace: a handclasp or handshake, which is an expression of peace, communion, and charity.</p>
<h3>Breaking of the Bread</h3>
<p class="rubric">During the breaking of the host the following is sung or said:</p>

        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<p class="rubric">After the Lamb of God, the people kneel.</p>
<h3>Invitation to Communion</h3>
<p class="rubric">After his private prayers of preparation the Priest genuflects, takes the host and, holding it slightly raised above the paten or above the chalice says aloud:</p>
<div class="celebrant">
    <div class="celebrant v">Behold the Lamb of God,</div>
    <div class="celebrant v">behold him who takes away the sins of the world.</div>
    <div class="celebrant v">Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb.</div>
</div>
<p class="rubric">And together with the people he adds once:</p>
<div class="people">
    <div class="v">Lord, I am not worthy</div>
    <div class="v">that you should enter under my roof,</div>
    <div class="v">but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.</div>
</div>
<h3>Communion</h3>
<p class="rubric">After the priest has reverently consumed the Body and Blood of Christ the communicants come forward in reverent procession, and make a preparatory act of reverence by bowing their head in honour of Christ&rsquo;s presence in the Sacrament. They receive Holy Communion standing. The Priest says:</p>
<div class="celebrant">The Body <span class="rubric">(</span>Blood<span class="rubric">)</span> of Christ.</div>
<p class="rubric">The communicant replies:</p>
<div class="people">Amen.</div>
<p class="rubric">When Communion is ministered under both kinds the minister of the Chalice raises it slightly and shows it to each of the communicants, saying:</p>
<div class="celebrant">The Blood of Christ.</div>
<p class="rubric">The communicant replies:</p>
<div class="people">Amen.</div>
<p class="rubric">After the distribution of Communion, if appropriate, a sacred silence may be observed for a while, or a psalm or other canticle of praise or a hymn may be sung.</p>
<h3>Prayer after Communion</h3>
<p class="rubric">Then, the Priest says:</p>
<div class="celebrant">Let us pray.</div>
<p class="rubric">All stand and pray in silence. Then the Priest says the Prayer after Communion, at the end of which the people acclaim:</p>
<div class="people">Amen.</div>
<div class="explanation">
    <h1><span style="color: #ff0000;">The Concluding Rites</span></h1>
    <p>The brief Concluding Rite sends the people forth to put into effect in their daily lives the Mystery of Christ&rsquo;s Death and Resurrection and the unity in Christ which they have celebrated. Their mission is to witness to Christ in the world and to bring the Gospel to the poor.</p>
</div>
<p class="rubric">Any brief announcements to the people follow here. Then the dismissal takes place. Sometimes this takes a more elaborate form than that given below.</p>
<h3>Blessing</h3>
<p class="rubric">The Priest says:</p>
<div class="celebrant">The Lord be with you.</div>
<p class="rubric">The people reply:</p>
<div class="people">And with your spirit.</div>
<p class="rubric">The Priest blesses the people, saying:</p>
<div class="celebrant">
    <div class="celebrant v">May almighty God bless you,</div>
    <div class="celebrant v">the Father, and the Son, <span class="signofthecross">✠</span> and the Holy Spirit.</div>
</div>
<p class="rubric">The people reply:</p>
<div class="people">Amen.</div>
<h3>Dismissal</h3>
<p class="rubric">Then the Deacon, or the Priest himself, says:</p>
<div class="celebrant"><span class="rubric">Either:</span> Go forth, the Mass is ended.</div>
<div class="celebrant"><span class="rubric">Or:</span> Go and announce the Gospel of the Lord.</div>
<div class="celebrant"><span class="rubric">Or:</span> Go in peace, glorifying the Lord by your life.</div>
<div class="celebrant"><span class="rubric">Or:</span> Go in peace.</div>
<p class="rubric">The people reply:</p>
<div class="people">Thanks be to God.</div>
