<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Prayer of St. Thomas Aquinas</span></p>
<p>I render thanks to Thee, O Lord, Holy Father, Everlasting God,</p>
<p>who hast vouchsafed, not for any merits of mine, but of Thy great</p>
<p>mercy only, to feed me a great sinner, Thine unworthy servant, with</p>
<p>the precious Body and Blood of Thy Son, our Lord Jesus Christ&nbsp;; and</p>
<p>I pray that this Holy Communion may not be for my judgment and</p>
<p>condemnation, but for my pardon and salvation. Let it be unto me an</p>
<p>armor of faith and a shield of good purpose, a riddance of all vices,</p>
<p>and a rooting out of all evil desires&nbsp;; an increase of love and patience,</p>
<p>of humility and obedience, and of all virtues&nbsp;; a firm defense against</p>
<p>the wiles of all my enemies, visible and invisible&nbsp;; a perfect quieting</p>
<p>of all my impulses, fleshy and spiritual&nbsp;; a cleaving unto Thee, the</p>
<p>one true God&nbsp;; and a blessed consummation of my end when Thou</p>
<p>dost call. And I pray that Thou wouldst vouchsafe to bring me a</p>
<p>sinner to that unspeakable Feast where Thou, with Thy Son and Thy</p>
<p>Holy Spirit, art to Thy holy ones true light, full blessedness,</p>
<p>everlasting joy, and perfect happiness Through the same Christ our</p>
<p>Lord. Amen.</p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Prayer of St. Bonaventure</span></p>
<p>O most sweet Lord Jesus Christ, transfix the affections of my</p>
<p>inmost soul with that most joyous and healthful wound of Thy love,</p>
<p>with true, serene, holiest Apostolic charity, that my soul may ever</p>
<p>languish and melt with genuine love and longing for Thee, that it</p>
<p>may desire Thee, and faint for Thy courts, long to be dissolved and to</p>
<p>be with Thee. Grant that my soul may hunger after Thee, the Bread of</p>
<p>Angels, the Refreshment of holy souls, our daily and supersubstantial</p>
<p>Bread, who hast all sweetness and savor, and the sweetness of every</p>
<p>taste. Let my heart ever hunger after and feed upon Thee, upon whom</p>
<p>the Angels desire to look, and my inmost soul be filled with the</p>
<p>sweetness of Thy savor. May it ever thirst for Thee, the Fountain of</p>
<p>life, the Source of wisdom and knowledge, the Fountain of eternal</p>
<p>light, the Torrent of pleasure, the Richness of the House of God. May</p>
<p>it ever yearn for Thee, seek Thee, find Thee, stretch towards Thee,</p>
<p>attain to Thee, meditate upon Thee, speak of Thee, and do all things</p>
<p>to the praise and glory of Thy holy name, with humility and</p>
<p>discretion, with love and delight, with readiness and affection, with</p>
<p>perseverance even unto the end. And be Thou ever my hope and my</p>
<p>whole confidence&nbsp;; my riches&nbsp;; my delight, my pleasure, and my joy&nbsp;;</p>
<p>my rest and tranquillity&nbsp;; my peace, my sweetness and my fragrace&nbsp;;</p>
<p>my sweet savor, my food and refreshment&nbsp;; my refuge and my help&nbsp;;</p>
<p>my wisdom&nbsp;; my portion, my possession, and my treasure, in whom</p>
<p>my mind and my heart may ever</p>
